		<p>If you will go to the XDA page of this mod you will see that the creator of this mod promises a lot of things. So I got interested and went ahead on trying out this mod. I don't usually take any kind of backups and in this case as well it continued.</p>
		<p>Flashing was easy as always, <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2634729" target="_blank">the orignal post at xda</a> had two Google Drive links to download the <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0ByszKrUuNNt8ZjN1dFNndUFzclk&usp=sharing#list" target="_blank">eXtremeBeats Audio Mod</a> itself and <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0ByszKrUuNNt8QXZDRW1YOWR5OVU&usp=sharing&tid=0ByszKrUuNNt8ZjN1dFNndUFzclk" target="_blank">audio profiles for Viper4android</a>. I downloaded the Mod itself and flashed it. At this point after successful flash and a restart I checked the music quality, it was almost like before.</p>
