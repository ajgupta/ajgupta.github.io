		<p>Its 4:42 AM in the morning, and I am at day one of <a href="http://ajay-gupta.com/Microsoft-Ventures-Hackday-2014/" target="_blank">Microsoft Ventures Hackday 2014</a> in Bangalore, India. And I am writing a <a href="http://ajay-gupta.com/Microsoft-Ventures-Hackday-2014-Aftermath/" target="_blank">follow up post</a> for <a href="http://ajay-gupta.com/Microsoft-Ventures-Hackday-2014/" target="_blank">Microsoft Ventures Hackday 2014</a>.
		<p>So today I left my Office around 4:20PM, rushing to the bus stop to catch a bus so that I can reach Microsoft's office on time. But I forgot that this is <b>Bangalore</b> and after 4:30 traffic becomes a big issue. After nervously waiting for 10-15mins I climbed onto a bus going towards Lavelle Road. Thank god the bus was almost empty and air-conditioned, after carrying my laptop for around a kilometer the last thing I would have wanted was a crowded non-air conditioned bus. I have a habit of checking the path via Google Maps to check whether the bus is taking the shortest route or not. But unfortunately the bus driver took the bus from a longer and much busier route. It took almost an hour and 20 minutes to cover 20KM. Finally the bus dropped me off near to Lavelle Road. I had Google maps opened in my mobile with the coordinates pushed in, so I immediately paced towards the Microsoft office. It was nearby I reached their at 5:55.
		As I entered Microsoft building, the guards gave me a Microsoft Visitor Badge. The badge allowed me to go to the conference room named Vigyan on ground floor. Then I was given a Wifi password (for internet access on my laptop) and a Microsoft Ventures T-shirt. At sharp 6 o clock we were all called inside the conference room. Inside all the startup founders started giving a little intro about their API's. Soon after we were told to start working on our ideas. Around 8:30 we had Pizza and Coke for dinner. After that for the whole night there was Coffee, chips, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vada_pav" target="_blank">Vada Pav's</a> and Energy drinks. Overall it was fun working through the night.</p>  
		<p>As expected I was struggling a lot as my DB knowledge wasn't of much use. But I managed through without giving much headaches to teammates. Nevertheless a rewarding day, learned about quite a few API's from <a href="http://www.frrole.com/api" target="_blank">Frrole</a>, <a href="http://api.thinknest.co/" target="_blank">Thinknest</a>, <a href="http://ioinfo.distilbio.com/hackathon/api/docs/tutorial" target="_blank">Metaome</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SupportBee/SupportBee-Apps" target="_blank">SupportBee</a>, <a href="http://docspad.com/developer/introduction/gettingstarted" target="_blank">Docspad</a>.</p>
		The next day as I was checking through the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/microsoftventuresinindia" target="_blank">Facebook page of Microsoft Ventures</a>, I found the following images of the event:</p>

<p>By the way that's me in the center of the below image trying to find a charging point for my laptop (Tall guy in black jeans, looking down). It feels nice to be on their Facebook page!</p>
