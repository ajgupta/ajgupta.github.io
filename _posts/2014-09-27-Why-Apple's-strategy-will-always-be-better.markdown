		<p>A couple of weeks back Apple just pulled off anathor successful launch of it's <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/" target="_blank">new iPhone (or rather iPhones)</a>. This has been a trend, there hasn't been an iPhone launch that has failed to mesmerise the public. Where as competitors like Samsung, Sony and HTC have launched many phones that didn't reached the limelight.</p>
		<p>Much of it is because of Apple's strategy of maintaining only a limited number of phone (The iPhones) instead of myriad of phones like its competitors like Samsung. Maintaining only a limited number of devices gives you numerous advantages. Since the architecture is same so developers don't need to think about maintaining there apps on various devices unlike in Android you need to take care for every device you want tto support. Also since Apple only works on iPhones that gives them the inherent advantage that they can devote all their research to form and improve a single device. Unlike competitors who launch many phones in a single year let alone their lifetime. There are other advantages as well like since you only have a limited range of devices thus you have a dedicated fanbase that you have developed over the years, which in case of Apple is quite huge.</p>
		<p>But even after all these advantages to remain in the market you need to innovate. Apple hasn't quite failed till now in terms of innovation. Take the example of the new generation of iPhones: not many people know that the new iPhones are encrypted with a key that <b>only</b> the user knows thus making these phones very safe from any kind of data theft or NSA thingy. So if tomorrow the government or the NSA wants your phone data then Apple will say that 'the phone is encrypted with the user's password and we don't keep that'.</p>
