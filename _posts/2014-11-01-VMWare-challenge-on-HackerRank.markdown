		<p>Recently I appeared for the VMWare pre-interview Evaluation challenge on HackerRank. There was only one question to solve in the given 90 minutes. The question was as follows:</p>
		<script src="<script src="https://gist.github.com/ajgupta/5fd26188409ad2a29d7d.js"></script>"></script>
		<p>The solution didn't clicked me then, but this is what I came up with. Not the most efficient solution, but it works.</p>
		<script src="https://gist.github.com/ajgupta/5baa992246177ec237d4.js"></script>
		<p>Note: I haven't considered the case where all inputs are passed as 1 and no flipping is done (Ambiguity, not mentioned in the question). Also <b>in the inputs you only pass the array not the size.</b> If you want to pass size as well then add an if condition where if i is zero then parseInt into a size variable and in else the array.</p>
