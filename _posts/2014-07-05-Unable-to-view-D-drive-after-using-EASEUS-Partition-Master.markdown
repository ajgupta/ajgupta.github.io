		<p>Its 4:42 AM in the morning, and I am at day one of <a href="http://ajay-gupta.com/Microsoft-Ventures-Hackday-2014/" target="_blank">Microsoft Ventures Hackday 2014</a> in Bangalore, India. I have finished my part in the webapp that my team is making. Quite a tiring night till now as it's been a long time since I have pulled an all nighter. Nevertheless a rewarding day, learned about quite a few API's from <a href="http://www.frrole.com/api" target="_blank">Frrole</a>, <a href="http://api.thinknest.co/" target="_blank">Thinknest</a>, <a href="http://ioinfo.distilbio.com/hackathon/api/docs/tutorial" target="_blank">Metaome</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SupportBee/SupportBee-Apps" target="_blank">SupportBee</a>, <a href="http://docspad.com/developer/introduction/gettingstarted" target="_blank">Docspad</a>.</p>
		<p>Expected more people than what were present here today, but overall a good crowd. Of course some people have fallen asleep! Had Pizza and Coke in lunch and then snacks and Coffee have been here all the time (Programmer's fuel!).</p>
		<p>I left my Office around 4:20PM rushing to the bus stop to catch a bus so that I can reach Microsoft's office on time. But I forgot this is Bangalore and after 4:30 traffic becomes a big issue. After nervously waiting for 10-15mins I climbed onto a bus going towards Lavelle Road. Thank god the bus was almost empty and air-conditioned, after carrying my laptop for around a kilometer the last thing I would have wanted was a crowded non-air conditioned bus. I have a habit of checking the path via Google Maps to check whether the bus is taking the shortest route or not. But my luck had ran its course, bus driver took the bus from a longer and much busier route. It took almost an hour and 20 minutes to cover 20KM. Finally the bus dropped me near to Lavelle Road. I had Google maps opened in my mobile with the coordinates pushed in, so I immediately paced towards the Microsoft office. It was nearby I reached their at 5:55.
		somehow get on time  as I entered Microsoft building, the guards gave me a Microsoft Visitor Badge. The badge allowed us to go to the conference room named Vigyan on ground floor. Then I was given a Wifi password (for internet access on my laptop) and a Microsoft Ventures T-shirt. At sharp 6 o clock we were all called inside the conference room. Inside all the startup founders started giving a little intro about their API's. Soon after we were told to start working on our ideas. Around 8:30 we had Pizza and Coke for dinner. After that for the whole night there was Coffee, chips and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vada_pav" target="_blank">Vada Pav's</a>. Overall it was fun working through the night.</p>  
		<p>As expected I was struggling a lot as my DB knowledge wasn't of much use. But I managed through without giving much headaches to teammates. Anyways I worked on Google Maps API which proved to be knowledgeable.</p>
		
		
		
		
		
		I have been wanting to go to a hackathon for a long time. I was late in applying for Google Hackathon this year. Somehow I stumbled upon <a href="https://hacknight.in/microsoftventures/2014s-bangalore#/participants" target="_blank">Microsoft Ventures Hackathon</a>.</p>
		<p>On the front page it says:</p>
		<blockquote>Microsoft Ventures presents an exclusive hackday; a chance for top developers to dive into application development using the APIs of our portfolio companies. The hackday will be held on July 4th & 5th at the Microsoft Ventures office in Bangalore. So if you want to hack on bleeding-edge APIs of cutting-edge companies - this is where you've gotta be!
		</blockquote>
		<p>I applied for the hackday 2 weeks back and today my registration got confirmed and I got the confirmation mail as well. The mail was as follows:</p>

		<p>The location of Hackathon is <a href="http://binged.it/1lrHFc7" target="_blank">Ground Floor of Microsoft Vigyan</a>, Lavelle Road, Bangalore, Karnataka, India. Interestingly at the time of this post if you search for this location on Google maps then you won't get any result.. Nice work Google!</p>
		<p>Anyways I will carry myself and my Dell 2520 to this location and see how it goes. I am an Oracle Apps developer, so I can definitely help out someone with Database (I work on Oracle DB 10g, although nobody will be using Oracle!). Other than that I am a fair presenter. In the mail as you can see the devs need to pitch their ideas/apps as well, so I might just be helpful there.</p>
		<p>My location this weekend:</p>
