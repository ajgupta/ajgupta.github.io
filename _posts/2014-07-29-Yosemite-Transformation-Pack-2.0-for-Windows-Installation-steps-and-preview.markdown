		<p><a href="http://www.windowsxlive.net/yosemite-transformation-pack/" target="_blank">Yosemite Transformation Pack 2.0</a> is a complete Transformation pack for Windows operating systems, which will give you a GUI similar to <a href="https://www.apple.com/osx/preview/" target="_blank">Apple - OS X Yosemite</a>.</p>
		<p>You can download it from various sources:</p>

		<p><b>Important thing before installing Yosemite Transformation Pack:</b> Make a System restore point before installing Yosemite Transformation Pack on your system. For creating a restore point just type "Create a restore point" in your Start search.</p>

		<p>Creating a restore point is important before installing any transformation packs, as these packs patch your system files and anything can go wrong. So better have a system restore point to recover from. Also in case you uninstall this transformation pack and you are not getting your Windows 7 default theme back then also you can use the restore point. Now when you double click on the installer then you might get a message like this:</p>

		<p>Just restart your computer and run the setup again and you will see a screen similar to this:</p>

		<p>During installation your screen might go black, but don't worry after a few minutes you will see the following message asking for your permission to restart the computer.</p>

		<p>After restart the Yosemite Transformation Pack will be completely applied. Here are a few screenshots of my system.</p>

		<p>The last screen is the so called "Launchpad", it comes up when you double click on empty space on desktop.</p>
		<p>Overall the Yosemite Transformation Pack looks good and I might just keep it for some time.</p>
