		<p>I own a Samsung Galaxy Note N7000. Till now I had Cyanogenmod installed on it. But I was getting tired of it as Cyanogenmod is not releasing any <b>stable</b> updates for it. So a week ago I installed Paranoid Android ROM Android 4.4.4. I was really fortunate as the stable version was only released on 25th June 2014.</p>
		<p>First I downloaded the <a href="http://aospal.hostingsharedbox.com/aospal/roms/n7000/" target="blank">Paranoid Android ROM</a>. Then I downloaded Micro module Google Apps package from <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2397942" target="blank"</a>XDA Developers</a>. I emptied my SD Card and added both of the above files into it. Then I booted up the Galaxy Note to recovery mode by holding the Volume up + Power + Home buttons together. Then I did a factory reset, wiped cache, wiped Dalvik cache. Then I installed both the files from SD card. Again cleared Dalvik cache and wiped cache partition. And then finally restarted the N7000 to complete the process. </p>
		<p>After the restart it got stuck at the boot animation screen:</p>

		<p>So I used the power button and force restarted the Note and voila! it worked. The phone restarted perfectly and I was able to add my Google account.</p>
		<p>Since then its been a few days since I have been on this ROM. Paranoid Android is mostly stable other than a few hiccups.</p>
		<p>The following is a screen shot of my homescreen. You can notice the semi transparent notification bar at the top. The icons are a bit bigger. Mostly clean UI.</p>

		<p>If we go into the Apps showcase you might again notice the icons are a bit bigger.</p>

		In the About phone you can see the Android version 4.4.4 and the Paranoid Android version 4.4.
