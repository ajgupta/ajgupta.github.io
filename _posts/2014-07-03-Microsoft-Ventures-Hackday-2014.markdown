		<p>I have been wanting to go to a hackathon for a long time. I was late in applying for Google Hackathon this year. Somehow I stumbled upon <a href="https://hacknight.in/microsoftventures/2014s-bangalore#/participants" target="_blank">Microsoft Ventures Hackathon</a>.</p>
		<p>On the front page it says:</p>
		<blockquote>Microsoft Ventures presents an exclusive hackday; a chance for top developers to dive into application development using the APIs of our portfolio companies. The hackday will be held on July 4th & 5th at the Microsoft Ventures office in Bangalore. So if you want to hack on bleeding-edge APIs of cutting-edge companies - this is where you've gotta be!
		</blockquote>
		<p>I applied for the hackday 2 weeks back and today my registration got confirmed and I got the confirmation mail as well. The mail was as follows:</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>Hello Folks,</p>
		
		<p>Our startups are ready to hack with you on their brand-spanking-new APIs and we hope you're as revved up as we are!</p>
		
		<p>We'll have minimal overhead and maximal hacking:</p>
		
		<p>Registration: 5-6pm<br>
		APIs explained & house rules: 6-7pm<br>
		Hack/Fuel/Hack/Fuel/Hack/Fuel: 7pm-2:30pm<br>
		Finish up hacks by 2:30pm<br>
		Pitches (3min each): 2:30-4:30pm<br>
		Judging: 4:30-5:30pm<br>
		Prizes: 5:30pm<br>
		We have some cool prizes from Microsoft Ventures and also from our startups.</p>
		
		<p>Dinner, snacks, energy drinks, breakfast & lunch provided - BRAINS, BODIES, & LAPTOPS are things you should bring :)</p>
		
		<p>Important: We have a waiting list, so if any of you are not coming tomorrow, please let us know ASAP, so we can admit people on the waitlist.</p>

		<p>The location of Hackathon is <a href="http://binged.it/1lrHFc7" target="_blank">Ground Floor of Microsoft Vigyan</a>, Lavelle Road, Bangalore, Karnataka, India. Interestingly at the time of this post if you search for this location on Google maps then you won't get any result.. Nice work Google!</p>
		<p>Anyways I will carry myself and my Dell 2520 to this location and see how it goes. I am an Oracle Apps developer, so I can definitely help out someone with Database (I work on Oracle DB 10g, although nobody will be using Oracle!). Other than that I am a fair presenter. In the mail as you can see the devs need to pitch their ideas/apps as well, so I might just be helpful there.</p>
		<p>My location this weekend:</p>
