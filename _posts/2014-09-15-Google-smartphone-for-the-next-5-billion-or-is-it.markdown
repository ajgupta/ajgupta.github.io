		<h2>A brief look at Android One</h2>
		<p>Today at a global launch event in India Google introduced its first generation of Android One smartphones. These smartphones are competitively priced at 6399 rupees or around 105 Dollars. Google made these phones in alliance with Indian phone manufacturers Micromax, Karbonn and Spice. The three phones that were launched were Karbonn Sparkle V, Micromax Canvas A1 and Spice Dream UNO. The spec sheets for these smartphones is pretty decent for their price. Take a look at <a href="http://www.android.com/one/india/" target="_blank">Google's website</a> for more details.</p>
		<h2><a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.in/2014/09/for-next-five-billion-android-one.html" target="_blank">Smartphone(s) for the next 5 billion</a></h2>
		<p>Google announced these smartphones as "The smartphones for the next 5 billion" and they very well may be. At this price these smartphones are very good. You are getting a lot of smartphone for a mere 100 dollars. And wait that's not it. Google promises that these smartphones will always the latest version of Android. Yes that's true (for atlest next 2 years). That means you will get the much anticipated Android L update. You will also get 200MB of free mobile data each month on Airtel SIM for updating your Android One. Other benifits include a free 12 month subscription for Google Play Newsstand and watching Youtube Videos offline for free (a paid service which Google will be announcing soon). That's not it the online retailers (Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal) have some great offers of their own with the purchase of Android One.</p>
		<h2>But then what was Moto E that Google announced a few month back?</h2>
		<p>According to Charlie Tritschler, Motorola's senior vice-president of products: "The Moto E was designed to specifically compete against feature phones in emerging markets. The Moto E's goal is to end <b>the feature phone</b>, and the device is primarily targeted towards <b>people who have been on the edge for a while but just didnâ€™t think they could afford [a smartphone]</b>".</p>
		<p>So in short Motorola (an entity of Google at the time Moto E was announced) itself says that their smartphone Moto E was designed for people who couldn't afford a smarphone otherwise (or what Google refers as "The next five billion").</p>
		<p>But let's not get cynical here as Moto E was announced 4 months back and maybe Google took some strides forward to reduce the overall price. And also Moto E and Android One are developed by different companies in different countries (China vs India) so that maybe a contributing factor.</p>
		<h2>What's the deal with Redmi 1S?</h2>
		<p>Redmi 1S is a smartphone made by a chinese company Xiaomi. Xiaomi is famous for manufacturing brilliantly specced phones like Mi2 and Mi3. Redmi 1S is a smartphone which is priced at 5999 rupees or around 98 dollars. It has better screen, better processor, better performance than Moto E or Android One. You can <a href="http://www.bgr.in/news/spice-android-one-dream-uno-mi-498-vs-xiaomi-redmi-1s-specifications-and-features-compared/" target="_blank">compare the specs of Android One and Redmi 1S</a> yourself.</p>
